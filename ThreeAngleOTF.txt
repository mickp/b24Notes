DATA ACQUISITION
================

Locate a bead with a clean background at least 1/4 of the field clear around it (even away from focus).

Laser:  488nm
Camera: wheel
Filter: GFP (515)

Set the laser power to 40mW and exposure time to 5ms.
Set the camera as follows:
  EM 5MHz
  EM gain 200
  clean, no FT  (this is the default setting)

Single-site experiment
Set up as in fig 001.
Filename suffix should be
  PSF-excitation-emission
  ***THERE MUST BE NO SPACES IN THE FILENAME***
Click 'Update' to set timestamp on file.
Click 'Start' to run.


ANALYSIS
========
Open the VM.
***NEVER CLOSE softWoRx***
***NEVER LOG OUT OF THE VM***
***TO CLOSE THE VM, CLICK THE TOP RH 'X', CHOOSE 'SAVE MACHINE STATE' THEN CLICK 'OK'***
(Figure CloseVM)
username: map
password: micron1
softWoRx will be running.
Figure 002
Close any open image windows.  ***DO NOT CLOSE THE MAIN SOFTWORX WINDOW OR TERMINAL***
Figure 003
softWoRx window: 
	* File->Open
	Open the data file you acquired.
Image window: 
	Use left scrollbar to shift focal plane and find your bead.
	* Image window: File->Save
	Drag the save window to the right of the image window.
	* Save window: Select Region
	Drag a red box around the bead in the image window.
	* Save window: Details...
	* Region details window: adjust X/Y/Width/Height to centre bead in a 256x256 box
	Figure 004
	* Region details window: close
	* Save file window: add '-CROP' in 'Output' between 'SI' and '.dv' (Figure 005)
	* Save file window: 'Do it'
	This:
		saves the cropped region to a new file, 
		closes your original file,
		opens the crop file.
	Close the crop file for now.


	=== Widefield PSF generation ===
	softWoRx window: Process->Generate Widefield from SI Image
		opens the 'Generate OMX Widefield Image' window.
		Click 'Input' and choose the crop file.
		This also populates the Output filename field - leave it as it is.
		Check the 'Average directions' box.
		(Figure 006)
		Click 'Do it'.
		This closes your cropped image and opens the pseudo-widefield (WF) image.
		Close the pseudo-WF window.


	=== Angle extraction ===  will repeat 3 times
	* Open the cropped image.
	* Cropped image window: File->Save
	* Save window: Details...
	* Details window
		Find 'Z row: Start/End/Inc'
		make a note of End (should be 1140 if following acquisition instructions)
		First run through: 
			set End to original value / 3 (380)
		Second run through:
			set Start to (original value / 3) + 1  (381)
			set End to (2 * original value / 3)   (760)
		Third run through:
			set Start to (2 * original value / 3) + 1   (761)
			set End to original End value   (1140)
		click 'Close'
	* Save window: 
		First run through:
			replace 'CROP' in filename with 'A0'
		Second run through:
			replace 'CROP' in filename with 'A1'
		Third run through:
			replace 'CROP' in filename with 'A2'
		click 'Do it'
	This:
	 	saves angle-N slices to new file
	 	closes the crop file
	 	opens the a0 file
	Reopen the crop file and repeat from === Angle extraction === for a total of 3 times.

	For each angle file:
		softWoRx window: Process -> Make OMX OTF
			Opens the OMX Create OTF window.
		OMX Create OTF window:
			click PSF-File, choose an angle file
			This creates a filename in the OTF file box.
			Change the OTF file name so that it ends with the angle number (A0, A1, A2)
			Uncheck 'Leave KZ'
			Uncheck 'Do bead compensation calculation'
