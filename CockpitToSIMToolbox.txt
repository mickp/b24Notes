SIMToolkit native order is (innermost first) phase, angle, z, time.
Open as Hyperstack in ImageJ.
Image-->Properties:
    Make a note of pixel width, pixel height and voxel depth.
    Channels to # phases
    Frames to # angles
    Z to original value / product(n_phases, n_angles)
    Close with OK.
Image-->Hyperstacks-->Stacks to hyperstack
Image-->Hyperstacks-->Re-order hyperstack:
    channels -> channels
    slices -> frames
    frames -> slices
    OK
Images-->Hyperstack-->Hyperstack to stack.
Save to TIF. Data should now be ordered phase, angle, z.

Angles are 36, 96, 156. (To confirm.)
